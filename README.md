# plastic-networks Readme
====================

This repository will store code associated with our plastic network model for tidewater glaciers.  As of the creation of this repository, major model functions are housed in "plastic-utilities-v2.py", and the network approach is handled in a separate script for each glacier simulated.  We are working to change how the model runs, so that it will be based on a class that contains model functions and can read in and store data for each glacier.
